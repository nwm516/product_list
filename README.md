# On viewing the Product List
Within your IDE, if starting from absolute scratch, navigate to where you want to install the Product List project and you must run "npx create-react-app product-list" to initialize a React application project. Then, you must enter "cd product-list" to change directories into the project file. 
Once there, run "npm start" to begin the application server. I would also run "npm install styled-components" additionally due to my inclusion of styled components for visual purposes.

Adding the ProductList.js, ProductList.css, and the App.js from the repo to the "src" branch of the project should allow this project to run locally. Any images files can be added to the "public" folder for local access, as well.

# On layout and styling choices
This project bears a resemblance to my Recipe Gallery project. I use the card style for products and use similar stylings, as well. I do include changes for backgrounds for both cards and page, and also include effects for hovering over the cards (which shows a light shadow under the card where the cursor is hovering over).
